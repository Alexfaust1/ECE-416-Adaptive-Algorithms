Problem Set 2 - BEAMFORMING

Just to quickly describe what is in this large file. Questions 1-4 can be found in the "ProblemSet2.m" folder and contain the original experiments and run cases. Most of my analyses and comments are in there. For question 5 parts A-C where I practically repeat everything in ProblemSet2.m I just copy and pasted most of the code from the "main" file and changed/tweaked the parameters that I was asked to tweak. 

My overall analyses for these problems is at the very bottom before my function section in the "CONCLUDING REMARKS" section. To avoid the 'pain' of running the Part A-C files for question 5 I believe it suffices to just read my comments at the bottom in this concluding remarks section to get a good gist of my fundamental findings.

If you would like to see my plots for each of the different sections I would suggest running ONCE the entire file
and then running each subsection in the '%%' 
						delimiters

Enjoy :D
